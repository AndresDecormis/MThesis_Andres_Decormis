centralisedv8-Standard: is the one with the standard formulation of the constraint
centralisedv8-FixedTempProfile: fixes the max temperature to be the minimum temperature that maintains the problem feasible
centralisedv8-AltConst: Just alters the constraint to include the slack inside the heat balance constraint.

Note: you can change the name in "other_notes" to give a new name to the results obtained.
